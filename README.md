# Titanic Survival Prediction  
Predicting Titanic passenger survival using machine learning.

## Overview  
This project uses the **Titanic dataset** to predict passenger survival based on factors like age, gender, and ticket class.  
It applies **machine learning models** such as logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks.

## Project Structure  
- Colab notebook for data exploration and modeling  
- Titanic dataset (`train.csv`, `test.csv`)   

## Dataset  
The dataset comes from [Kaggleâ€™s Titanic challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).  
It includes features like:  
- `Pclass` - Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)  
- `Sex` - Gender of the passenger  
- `Age` - Age of the passenger  
- `SibSp` - Number of siblings/spouses aboard  
- `Parch` - Number of parents/children aboard  
- `Fare` - Ticket fare price  

## Technologies Used  
- Python 
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)  
- Matplotlib (Visualization)  
- Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow (Machine Learning)
